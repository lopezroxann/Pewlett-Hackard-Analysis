# Overview of Project

## Purpose
We must determine the number of retiring employees per title while also identifing which employees will be eligible for the mentorship program. We would like our company to be prepared for the wave of employees who will reach retirement age.

## Results

It is important to not only research how many employees are reaching retirement age, but what current titles these employees hold.
<br/><br/>
Looking at the below chart, we can see that a big chunk of our near retirement group are currently Senior Engineers or hold a Senior Staff title:

**Retiring Titles:** <br/>

In order to better prepare for this wave, the company could begin actively recruiting to hire great candidates in time to be mentored prior to a current employee departing the company to assist with a better transition.
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, we can also look at current employees who can be promoted to these spots. It would be an easier shift to mentor an internal employee who knows the company and who fits well with the company's culture. We can filter the below table by title and then determine who may be interested in the mentorship program and could possibly be promoted.

## Summary
**How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**<br/>
There will be a total of 133,776 employees who will be ready for retirement over varying titles (refer to Retirement Titles table) in the next coming years:<br/>

<br/>That is a massive wave! But with the help of those leaving the company, we can better prepare ourselves to fill those important roles. The key is to start preparing those qualfied for the role early so that they can feel confident when it is time for them to be promoted.<br/>

**Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**<br/>
Looking at the below chart, I have grouped up the titles of those employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. There are plenty of retirement-ready staff to mentor those who are eligible for the program. It is crucial that we have knowledgeable staff to help the next generation of employees feel better prepared for their roles. This will help with employee retention in the long run and keep employee turnover low per title.<br/>

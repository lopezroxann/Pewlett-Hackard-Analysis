# Overview of Project

## Purpose
We must determine the number of retiring employees per title while also identifing which employees will be eligible for the mentorship program. We would like our company to be prepared for the wave of employees who will reach retirement age.

## Results

It is important to not only research how many employees are reaching retirement age, but what current titles these employees hold.
<br/><br/>
Looking at the below chart, we can see that a big chunk of our near retirement group are currently Senior Engineers or hold a Senior Staff title:

In order to better prepare for this wave, the company could begin actively recruiting to hire great candidates in time to be mentored prior to a current employee departing the company to assist with a better transition.
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, we can also look at current employees who can be promoted to these spots. It would be an easier shift to mentor an internal employee who knows the company and who fits well with the company's culture. We can filter the below table by title and then determine who many be interested in the mentorship program and could possibly be promoted.

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?


Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
